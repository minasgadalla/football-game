# football-game

A basic 2D football game!

In the beginning, the program creates the field of the football match and the user inserts some info regarding the teams. After the successful initialization, the program uses a simple probabilistic variable to create the actions of the players. The actions, movements of the Players and the ball happens in real-time and you have the option to reset the game if needed.

This project was created in 2015 for an OOP course when I was in the first year of Univesity.
